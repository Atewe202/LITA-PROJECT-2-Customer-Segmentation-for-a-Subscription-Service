This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify
segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI
dashboard that presents your analysis.

### Objectives of the Project
1. Excel:
 - Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
 - Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular
     subscription types.
 - Create any other interesting reports.
   
2. SQL:
 - to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write
     and validate your queries.
  - Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.

  - calculate total revenue by subscription type.
  - find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
  - find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
    
3. Power BI:
- Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments,
     cancellations, and subscription trends.
 - Include slicers for interactive analysis.
