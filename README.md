### LITA-PROJECT-2

### Topic:  Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service

### Summary of Porject
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify
segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI
dashboard that presents your analysis.

### Objectives of the Project
1. Excel:
 - Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
 - Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular
     subscription types.
 - Create any other interesting reports.
   
2. SQL:
 - to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write
     and validate your queries.
  - Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
  - retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
  - find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
  - find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
  - calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
  - find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
  - calculate total revenue by subscription type.
  - find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
  - find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
    
3. Power BI:
- Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments,
     cancellations, and subscription trends.
 - Include slicers for interactive analysis.
   
### Data Source
The dataset include the following key columns
- CustomerId: which is also a unique identifier assigned to each customer within the retail store

- Revenue: This is income generated by a business from it's normal bussiness activities


### Tools Used
-Excel: use of Pivot tables summarize total sales by product, region, and month,  use of charts, statistical functions and visualization
-SQL: Queries and aggregation 
- Power BI for Data visualization use of  Bar charts, pie charts, Dounts, Card
-  Use of Slicer as filter

### Data Cleaning Preparation
- Cleaning of data was done in excel to remove duplicates
- Duration of subscription in days column was created in excel before exporting to SQL studio and Power BI desktop
- conditional and custom columns were created in power BI

-  Insights
-  BASIC subcription was the most populous subscription type. Out of the a total of 67,540,175 gegenrated, 33,776,735 was from Basic subcriptiontupe, which represents 50% of the total revenue and a subscribersbase of 3,553,325. The other two types  Premium and Standard generated generated 16,899,064 (25%) and 16,864,376 (25%) respectively. the subscriber for Premium and Standard are 1,773,724 (25%) and 1,765,346(25%)
- The top performance of subscriptiontype BASIC could be due to:
   1. Affordability 
   2. the fact that it provides the essential features meeting the customers need
   3. It suits their simple requirement usage given that 50% of their customers are subscribed to this
      
 - the low patroage to Premium and Standard subcripttiontype may due to the prevailing economic situation
 - Review sales strtegies and optimize ressources to improve performance of the two subscription type

   - The analysis showed that of the 50% Basic subscribers 15% of them canceled their subscription while Premium and Standard subscribers had 15% each that canceled their subscription.
   - This high rate calls for reassessment of the processes in place.

      2. Availablility of services
      3. Prevailing economic situation and
      4. Market forces like competotors

   ### Recommendations

- The revenue generated across the regions is almost the same with little with no significant difference. This shows wide acceptance of service.
-  The highest revenue was generated from the East with a total revenue of 16,958,763 and a revenue percentage of 25,11% while the lowest revenue from the north was 16,819,972  with a percentage of 24.97%.
-  However of the 7,712,397 subscribers, 3,198,811 canceled their subscription which represents 45% of the total scribers.
-  A brakdown of canceled subscribers on regional basis showned that the highest came from the North, West and South with all ranking approximately 15% each of their total scribers.
-  incidentally no subscription was canceled by any subscriber in the East
   
 Inferences
- There is uniform customer needs across the regions
- Consistent marketing stategies
- comparable competition
- There is need to localise strategies to the regions to reduce ghigh rate of cancelation especially in the concerned regions
  
 Recommendation
- that there should be targeted investment in emerging markets
- strategies can also be basedd on regional perofrmance

- The is no distinct pattern noticed by the monthly subscription. 
- The reevenue generated ranges rom 3,326,152 to 3,437,444 and customernumber from 339,048 t0 372,900 with approximate percentage of 5%.

### Inference
- 60% of the revenue generated in 2022 was from Basic while the rest contributed 15% each of the total revenue generated in two years
- 40 % of the revenue generated in 2023 came from Basic while the rest contibuted 10% each of the total revuenue
- the contribution from each region is uniform across the board- 15% in 2022 and 10% in 2023

Recommendation
- There is need to expand market effort in all the regions
- Examine impact of pricing on revenue growth
- Monthly promotions  can be introduced e.g incentives/discount for early subscription
