### LITA-PROJECT-2

### Topic:  Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service

### Summary of Porject
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify
segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI
dashboard that presents your analysis.

### Objectives of the Project
1. Excel:
 - Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
 - Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular
     subscription types.
 - Create any other interesting reports.
   
2. SQL:
 - to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write
     and validate your queries.
  - Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
  - retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
  - find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
  - find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
  - calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
  - find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
  - calculate total revenue by subscription type.
  - find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
  - find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
    
3. Power BI:
- Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments,
     cancellations, and subscription trends.
 - Include slicers for interactive analysis.

The dataset include the following key columns
- CustomerId: which is also a unique identifier assigned to each customer within the retail store

- Region: The geographical area

- Revenue: This is income generated by a business from it's normal bussiness activities


### Tools Used
-Excel: use of Pivot tables summarize total sales by product, region, and month,  use of charts, statistical functions and visualization
-SQL: Queries and aggregation 
- Power BI for Data visualization use of  Bar charts, pie charts, Dounts, Card
-  Use of Slicer as filter

### Data Cleaning Preparation
- Cleaning of data was done in excel to remove duplicates
- Duration of subscription in days column was created in excel before exporting to SQL studio and Power BI desktop
- conditional and custom columns were created in power BI

### Explaratory Data Analysis
Excel:summarize
- Total sales by product:- BASIC subcription was the most populous subscription type. Out of a total of 33,776,735 with a total subscribers of 16,921.
- This was followed by Premium with total revenue of  16,899x,064 with 8,446 subcribers while Standard was 16,864,376 with 8,420 subscribers.
- This could be due
   1. Affordability 
   2. the fact that it provides the essential features meeting the customers need
   3. It suits their simple requirement usage
- Total sales by Region:- 
- Total sales by Month:
o Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and
total revenue by region.
o Create any other interesting report
2. SQL:
Hint â€“ You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and
validate your queries.
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
o retrieve the total sales for each product category.
o find the number of sales transactions in each region.
o find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
o calculate total revenue per product.
o calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
o find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
o calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
o identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
3. Power BI:
o Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The
dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and
regional breakdowns.
### Data Analysis
- - Datedif(SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd, "D") was used to calculate duration
-  =Average Subscription Duration() was used to calculate average subscription duration
 - =Countif() was used to calculate the most populous subscriptiontype
